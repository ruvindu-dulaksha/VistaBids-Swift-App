# Duplicate Declarations Fix

## Problem
The project had multiple duplicate declarations that were causing compilation errors:

1. `AppleTranslationService` was declared in both:
   - `/VistaBids/Services/AppleTranslationService.swift`
   - `/VistaBids/Models/CommunityModels.swift`

2. `ChatListView` was declared in both:
   - `/VistaBids/Screens/ChatViews.swift`
   - `/VistaBids/Views/ChatListView.swift`

3. `ChatDetailView` was declared in both:
   - `/VistaBids/Screens/ChatViews.swift`
   - `/VistaBids/Views/ChatListView.swift`

4. `LanguageSelector` was declared in both:
   - `/VistaBids/Screens/CommunityScreenNew.swift`
   - `/VistaBids/Views/ChatListView.swift`

## Solution

### 1. Fixed AppleTranslationService
- Removed the duplicate implementation from `CommunityModels.swift`
- Kept only the `TranslationServiceProtocol` definition in `CommunityModels.swift`
- Updated `AppleTranslationService.swift` to implement `TranslationServiceProtocol` instead of its own protocol
- Fixed the `detectLanguage` method to match the protocol requirements

### 2. Fixed ChatListView
- Kept the implementation in `ChatViews.swift`
- Replaced `ChatListView.swift` with a simple typealias to avoid breaking existing code:
  ```swift
  import SwiftUI
  
  // NOTE: ChatListView implementation has been moved to ChatViews.swift
  // This file exists to maintain backward compatibility
  // with existing code that imports ChatListView from this location
  
  // Forward the type from ChatViews.swift
  typealias ChatListViewCompatibility = ChatListView
  ```

### 3. Fixed ChatDetailView
- No changes needed as it will be accessed through the updated ChatListView references

### 4. Fixed LanguageSelector
- Kept separate implementations as they appear to have different designs and use cases:
  - `CommunityScreen.swift` has `LanguageSelectorOriginal`
  - `CommunityScreenNew.swift` has `LanguageSelector` for the community UI
  - `ChatViews.swift` has `LanguageSelector` for the chat UI

## Testing
After these changes, the code should compile without duplicate declaration errors. The functionality of the community page and chat features should work correctly with translation capabilities.
