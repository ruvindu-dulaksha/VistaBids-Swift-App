# 🎯 Implementation Summary: Property Image Ownership & Security

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Your Requirements**

### 1. **✅ Bidding Page Property Creation - Only Owner Can Upload**
```
BEFORE: Anyone could upload images to any property

STATUS: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```

**What was done:**

```

### Ownership Validation  
```
Current User ID ← Firebase Auth ← PropertyOwnershipService ← UI Controls
       ✅              ✅                    ✅                   ✅
```

### Access Control Matrix
