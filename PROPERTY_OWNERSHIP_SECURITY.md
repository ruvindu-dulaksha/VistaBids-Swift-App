# Property Ownership & Image Security Implementation

## Overview

Your VistaBids app now implements comprehensive property ownership controls and image security restrictions. This ensures that only property owners can upload, modify, or capture panoramic images, while other users can only view existing content.

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Property Ownership Control**
- Only the user who creates a property can upload/capture images
- Ownership is validated using Firebase Authentication user IDs
- Supports both `AuctionProperty` and `SaleProperty` models

### 2. **Image Upload Restrictions**
- **Property Creation**: Only authenticated users can capture/upload images during property creation
- **AR Viewing**: Users cannot upload new images while viewing AR panoramas
- **Non-Owners**: Other users cannot modify images for properties they don't own

### 3. **Authentication Integration**
- Seamless integration with your existing `FirebaseAuthService`
- Real-time authentication state monitoring
- Proper user session management

## 🛠 Implementation Details

### New Files Added

1. **`PropertyOwnershipService.swift`**
   - Centralized ownership validation service
   - Handles both AuctionProperty and SaleProperty models
   - Provides image storage and management capabilities

2. **`RestrictedARPanoramaView.swift`**
   - View-only AR panorama experience
   - No image upload/capture capabilities
   - Used for secure browsing of existing content

### Modified Files

1. **`AddPropertyForAuctionView.swift`**
   - Added authentication checks for image capture
   - Integrated PropertyOwnershipService
   - Shows appropriate messages for non-authenticated users

2. **`ARPanoramicView.swift`**
   - Added property ownership context
   - Conditional display of upload/capture buttons
   - Generic property type support (works with both auction and sale properties)

3. **Property Detail Views**
   - Updated to pass property context to AR views
   - Enables ownership validation during AR viewing

## 🔐 Security Flow

### Property Creation Process
```
1. User logs in → Authentication validated ✅
2. User navigates to "Add Property" → Ownership service initialized ✅
3. User can capture/upload images → Only if authenticated ✅
4. Property saved with user as owner → Firebase Auth UID stored ✅
```

### Property Viewing Process
```
1. Any user can view property listings ✅
2. Users can view existing panoramic images ✅
3. Only owners see upload/capture buttons ✅
4. Non-owners see view-only interface ✅
```

### AR Experience Security
```
1. AR viewing → Existing images only ✅
2. Image capture in AR → Disabled for all users ✅
3. Image upload in AR → Disabled for all users ✅
4. New image capture → Only during property creation ✅
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### Property Owners
- ✅ Can capture panoramic images during property creation
- ✅ Can select images from photo library during creation
- ✅ See all their uploaded images in AR view
- ✅ Have full control over their property's visual content

### Other Users
- ✅ Can view all existing panoramic images
- ✅ Can experience full AR immersion of properties
- ❌ Cannot upload or capture new images
- ❌ Cannot modify existing images
- ❌ Cannot access image upload controls

### Non-Authenticated Users
- ✅ Can browse properties
- ✅ Can view existing panoramic images
- ❌ Cannot create new properties
- ❌ Cannot upload any images
- ❌ See login prompts for image-related actions

## 📊 Data Persistence

### Image Storage
- **Local Storage**: Images saved to app documents directory
- **Naming Convention**: `panoramic_[UUID].jpg`
- **URL Format**: `local://filename.jpg`
- **Compression**: 80% JPEG quality for optimal performance

### Property Association
- **AuctionProperty**: Uses `sellerId` for ownership
- **SaleProperty**: Uses `seller.id` for ownership
- **PanoramicImage**: Linked to property via database relationship
- **Ownership Validation**: Real-time checks against Firebase Auth

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### PropertyOwnershipService
```swift
// Core ownership validation
func isOwner(of property: OwnableProperty) -> Bool {
    guard let currentUserId = currentUserId else { return false }
    return property.getOwnerId() == currentUserId
}

// Image modification permissions
func canModifyPanoramicImages(for property: OwnableProperty) -> Bool {
    return isOwner(of: property)
}

// Capture permissions during creation
func canCaptureImages() -> Bool {
    return currentUserId != nil
}
```

### Protocol-Based Design
```swift
protocol OwnableProperty {
    var panoramicImages: [PanoramicImage] { get }
    func getOwnerId() -> String
}

extension AuctionProperty: OwnableProperty {
    func getOwnerId() -> String { return sellerId }
}

extension SaleProperty: OwnableProperty {
    func getOwnerId() -> String { return seller.id }
}
```

## 🚨 Security Validations

### Client-Side Checks
- ✅ UI elements hidden/disabled for non-owners
- ✅ Real-time authentication state monitoring  
- ✅ Proper error messaging for unauthorized actions
- ✅ Graceful handling of authentication state changes

### Server-Side Protection (Future Enhancement)
- 🔄 Firebase Security Rules for image uploads
- 🔄 Server-side ownership validation
- 🔄 API endpoint protection
- 🔄 Audit logging for image operations

## 🎮 User Interface Changes

### Add Property Screen
```
BEFORE: Anyone could access image upload
AFTER:  Only authenticated users see upload options
        Non-authenticated users see login prompts
```

### AR Panorama View
```
BEFORE: Upload button visible to all users
AFTER:  Upload button only visible to property owners
        Other users see view-only interface
```

### Property Detail Views
```
BEFORE: Static AR view experience
AFTER:  Dynamic experience based on ownership
        Owners get full controls, others view-only
```

## 🔍 Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Property Owner
1. Log in as user A
2. Create property with images ✅
3. View AR panorama → Should see upload controls ✅
4. Capture/upload works ✅

### Test Case 2: Other User
1. Log in as user B  
2. View user A's property ✅
3. View AR panorama → No upload controls ✅
4. Can view existing images ✅

### Test Case 3: Non-Authenticated
1. Not logged in
2. Browse properties ✅
3. Cannot create property ❌
4. Cannot upload images ❌
5. See login prompts ✅
